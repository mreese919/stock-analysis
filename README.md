# stock-analysis

**Overview of tickers**

###The project is to review and find a new stock being traded that has better returns for my client Steve and his parents.

Comparing the mutiple stocks and their returns we hope to find new investment opprotunities that will have a higher chance

of having positive returns.

**Results of the tickers**

##The results of the analysis is that though many stocks had high returns in 2017. In 2018 many of these stocks lost those 

gained returns with the exception of ticker (ENPH). Ticker (ENPH) looks to be a better investment with better returns based

off the years analysized.

**Conclusion**
Concluding my finding I found to the greatest advantage of refactoring the code so analysizing the data the fastest and easiest

way of identifing stocks with the best returns with the dataset. I cannot conclude any disadvatages of refractoring except for 

the analyist must have an eye for detail and commenting on code.
